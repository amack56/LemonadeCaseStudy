# FinTech Case Study
![Company Logo](./lemonade-1.png) 
## Overview and Origin

* **Name of company**\
Lemonade, Inc.

* **When was the company incorporated?**\
April 2015

* **Who are the founders of the company?**\
Daniel Schreiber (former president of Powermat Technologies), Shai Wininger (co-founder of Fiverr) and Ty Sagalow

* **How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?**\
Schreiber and Wininger, both veterans of running start-ups and eager for a new opportunity, met in 2015. Schreiber had mulling the insurance field because he assumed the age-old industry was ripe for disruption. After meeting Wininger, who happened to be a coding and design whiz, the two began drawing out what their millenial-focused user would want to see in an insurance company (i.e. user friendly, non-human based interaction, quick and transparent transactions, etc.).


* **How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?**\
In its infancy, Lemonade was funded by early seed investors including Sequoia Capital and Aleph who in 2015 lent the comapny $13 million dollars. By April 2017, the company had raised around $180 million in multiple funding rounds and by April 2019 another $300 million. In July 2020 Lemonade went public and currently (July 2021) its enterprise value is estimated at $4.1 billion.
## Business Activities:

* **What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?**\
Lemonade saw the old insurance model as fraught with confusing products, hidden fees, frustrating claim processing times, and questionable ethics. In order to solve this they wanted to design an easy to use interface with chatbot customer support and artificial intelligence to create a better customer experience and establish cost savings. Unlike some of their competitors at the time they didn't sell policy of other insurers, but instead wrote the policies themselves in hopes of giving their more flexiblity and as an effort to increase revenue and profit margins. Further, they saw the old guard as less transparent in how it chooses to deny and accept claims and a public that was skeptical of the industry. Because of this they chose to only accept 25% of revenue for covering administration expenses and hopefully generating a profit, while using the other 75% to pay claims and if there was anything leftover, donate this income to charities of the customers' choosing. 

* **Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**\
Schreiber, the CEO, is quoted as saying "every person in the nation, in the world, needs insurance." In that vein, you would be safe to assume that everyone in the world is Lemonade's customer and that is true. However, the focus for Lemonade is the younger generation. Their entire business plan and especially front-end design is centered around what an ideal insurer would look like&mdash; from a Millenial's point of view. Curerntly Lemonade operates only in France and the United States. For some persepctive there are about 209 million adults in the U.S. and about 68 million adults in France. I excluded children because I assume most are not purchasing their own insurance. There are 72 million and 13 million Millenials in the U.S. and France, respecitively. Obviously that is quite a large potential customer base and with only a few tech-savvy competitors and a current market share of only 0.1% of the homeowners and renters insurance markets combined, that likely spells more growth for Lemonade. 

* **What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)**\
Lemonade's primary advantage is ease of use. Allowing the end user to instantly get product quotes via smartphone or pc along with the added benefit of almost lightning-fast claim distribution speaks to this ethos. Just as with many distrubitve financial tehcnology firms Lemonade is leveraging it's technology (AI, mahcine learning, chatbots, etc.) to add to this customer experience while at the same time reducing overhead. To add to that the company saw a need for a more trustworthy insurer and promises to donate extra profit to charity. To seperate itself even furhter from other insurtech competitors Lemonade chose to write all their policies as a traditional insurance company would in order to provide more flexibility. 

* **Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)**\
In a broader sense some of the technologies Lemonade is implementing are machine learning, artificial intelligence, and cross-platform access. Some of the applicaitons they are using to implement this are Python, NGINX, CloudFlare, TypeScript, Ruby, Swift, Go, OpenResty, Shell, Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Mandrill, Segment, Docker, WordPress, G Suite, and Medium. 


## Landscape:

* **What domain of the financial industry is the company in?**\
Insurance. More specifically, Insurtech. 

* **What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?**\
Since the advent of the internet and especially since the tech boom of the late 90s insurance companies have worked to make their products availabile online. However, bogged down by the relative complexity and vareity of products these companies struggled to make all their products comparable and immediately quotable in this fashion. With the recent advancement in AI and machine learning technologies as well as the increasing use of smartphones and apps over tradtiional web browsers, insurtech companies like Lemonade have made the same policies and products available but increased to comparability, user experience, and speed at which this information can be obtained. 

* **What are the other major companies in this domain?**\
Other major companies in the Insurtech domain include Next Insurance, Zipari, MetroMile, Corvus Insurance, Kin Insurance, Policygenius, Clearcover, Savvy, Ethos, and bolttech, and Hippo.
